# InnerSource Job Templates

A collection of job descriptions for InnerSource roles.
These are actual job descriptions of organizations that have recruited for these roles.

You may use these as templates for writing your own job descriptions.

_Note:_ This is not a listing of currently available roles.

## Ambition

Once we have collected a good amount of job descriptions, we may start to see that different organizations have a shared set of expectations for a given role.

That will allow us to co-author templates with a communal set of expectations for a given role.
Those templates could then be referenced from our InnerSource patterns as well e.g. from [Dedicated Community Leader](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/p/dedicated-community-leader).

## Maintainers

Collected through friendly contributions from InnerSource Commons contributors.

Maintained by the users listed in [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS).

## References

* The TODO Group has a [similar collection job descriptions](https://github.com/todogroup/job-descriptions) for open source program office (OSPO) roles. As InnerSource is close to open source but not the same, we find it helpful to collect InnerSource-specific roles here.
